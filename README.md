# Todo App
> A todo app using Vue and .NET Core 2.0.

## About
The idea behind this project is to create a fully featured, but simple to understand, todo app with VueJS 2 and .NET Core 2.0. I've planned to use PostgreSQL as my database, but with .NET Core 2.0 it should be fairly easy to change it to whatever you want.

I'm also doing this to learn more about Vue/.NET myself, so there might be some bugs initially!

## Planned Features
* Fully Vue-based frontend UI, using the Bulma CSS framework.
* Authentication with .NET Core 2.0 API.
* Store todos in PostgreSQL with .NET Core 2.0.
* Vuex store for local todo/session state.
* Vue routing with route guards.
* Comments everywhere to make it accessible for new Vue/.NET Core users.

#### Maybe?
* User profile pages to allow for multiple users.

## Vue Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
